## Project Outline and Purpose
The goal of this project is to model and simulate the spread of wildfires under varying environmental conditions using Monte Carlo simulations. By adjusting parameters such as tree species, humidity, temputure, wind speed, proximity to water bodies, we aim to assess and predict wildfire behavior. This model will help in understanding the dynamics of fire propagation and could potentially inform better wildfire management and response strategies.
## Hypothesis and Validation
Here's the overview of our hypothesis and validation
Hypothesis
1. The burned area is expected to increase by approximately 50% when the ignition point originates from bushland compared to forested areas composed of willow, pine, and oak trees.
2. Areas near water bodies with higher humidity are expected to show a significantly reduced probability of wildfire spread.
3. The higher the wind speed, the faster the spread of the wildfire and the shorter the time required for it to burn a given area.
Validation
1. Based on historical wildfire events, there are significant differences in wildfire propagation patterns depending on seasonal temperature and humidity levels.
